# Change Management

## The "Tower Problem"
During a modeling and development life cycle, data model changes and modications are just happening. You might want to add addtional fields that you have missed, or delete an outdated one instead. However, when **applying changes to existing data models can be critical, especially if they have dependencies and impact on other models**. This is true for changes that have been applied on the lower stack of the models and eventually the **modeling "tower" starts to wobble and and become very quickly inconsistent**.
