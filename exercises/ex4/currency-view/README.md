# Create Currency Views

Date: 2021-09-22

As of today, SAP Analytics Cloud must not access any table directly in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud due to security boundaries.
That applies also for the currency conversion relevant tables such as **TUCRR (Rates)**, **TCURX (Precisions)**, **TCURV (Configurations)**, **TCURF (Prefactors)**.

As a intermediate workaround you have to wrap the tables as views and declare them in the Currency Conversion function, e.g.

      ```javascript
      CONVERT_CURRENCY(
        "AMOUNT" => "NETAMOUNT", 
        "SOURCE_UNIT" => "CURRENCY", 
        "TARGET_UNIT" => 'EUR', 
        "CONVERSION_TYPE" => 'M', 
        "REFERENCE_DATE" => CURRENT_DATE, 
        "CLIENT" => '002', "SCHEMA" => 'ZST_WORKSHOP', 
        "ERROR_HANDLING" => 'set_to_null', 
        "STEPS" => 'shift,convert,round', 
        "PRECISIONS_TABLE" => '**VIEW_TCUR**', 
        "CONFIGURATION_TABLE" => '**V_TCURV**', 
        "PREFACTORS_TABLE" => '**V_TCURF**', 
        "RATES_TABLE" => '**V_TCURR**')
      ```
